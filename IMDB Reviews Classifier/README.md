This is a Natural Language Processing model designed and implemented using tensorflow.
The model is a (LSTM) neural network. In these type of networks, in addition to the context 
being passed like in an RNN, the LSTM have an additional pipeline of context called Cell State 
which passes through the network. This helps to keep the context from earlier tokens.
The GUI is written using Tkinter.
